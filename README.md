# recipe-catalog
Work in progress for a server and WebUI that tracks a users recipes and can log meals prepared with notes.

Users begin with no recipes and no meals logged, and work to create their unique cooking library. This is not an application for beginners to cooking, but rather for a somewhat experienced amateur chef who wants to track their cooking and develop their skills iteratively.

Intended user experience is where a user may log a meal, with notes, and then refer back to their logs to iterate and improve. A meal can be logged without indicating a recipe, and can simply be tagged with attributes like "fried rice" or "chicken pasta".

A user can then create a recipe, and a logged meal can be attached to only one recipe. Individual variation is seen within the log, but a recipe contains generic descriptions of how that meal will be expected to present.

The general idea is that a user logs meals easily, and recipes will be created when a user feels they have ownership over a particular type of meal they have been logging. Rather than finding a recipe online, users work to discover their individual spin on meals they like to make.
