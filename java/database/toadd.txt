meal if (recipe_id != null) then pull recipe from the database too, store as recipe object?

change meal controller /user function so that it only pulls a number of meal_ids and then as you
scroll it GET the meal
use an element that you check whether or not it is in the viewport
then load more meals
end of meals display a graphic

have "more about recipes and meals" pages
