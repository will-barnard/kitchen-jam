Since the website has been up for almost a year and my updates aren't on a regular schedule I'm going to begin announcing major changes here as I deploy them.\nIngredients, an essential aspect of meals and recipes, is now a useable component on Kitchen Jam.

Kitchen Jam is desperately in need of work on styles and editing forms. Other updates I'm looking toward on the horizon are User Profiles and friends, tagging friends, and more ways to explore the site. Needed updates include controls for editing your categories and tags.",
